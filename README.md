# Modulos
A device that will go on my desk and I can program it to add modules (hence the name), for example, I could add different widgets showing timers, weather and more.
**this project is INSPIRED by deskOS by harsh-thota and Side_Desk_Display by Srhurdirsati**
This is my first hardware project, meaning I have never used any CADs or any experience with hardware apart from UK secondary school curriculum.
