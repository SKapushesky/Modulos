## 10/20/2025 - Created project and wrote inital plan and introduction.  

**Hello! If you are reading this and looking for insporation, this is not the place to look at.**

Anyway, this is my project! I am planning to make a display thing where it sits on my desk and has a bunch of modules with somewhat useful information. I don't have any parts for this yet or any CAD files because as I said in the readme file, _I know nothing about hardware._

I also had to upload an image so here is an image of my github page.

See you in the next update,
