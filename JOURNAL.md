## 10/20/2025 - Created project and wrote inital plan and introduction.  

**Hello! If you are reading this and looking for insporation, this is not the place to look at.**

Anyway, this is my project! I am planning to make a display thing where it sits on my desk and has a bunch of modules with somewhat useful information. I don't have any parts for this yet or any CAD files because as I said in the readme file, _I know nothing about hardware._

I also had to upload an image so here is an image of my github page.

See you in the next update,

## 10/21/2025 - Gathered some more ideas for project  

I have half-thought, half-forked ideas! 

**What my display is going to do**

It is going to run off my laptop when its plugged in (maybe battery so dont have to plug in)

> Homepage: Show time, date, and small weather info somewhere.

> When clicked on (probably going to have a panel near display): Show different modules.

> Modules: Timer, Alarm, Music?, Notes/To-do list, Extended weather, photos (uploaded from google drive probably)

## 10/24/2025 - Researched parts  

I looked for parts for my project. (only main parts, PCB and stuff like headers not included)
Everything is from PIhut

TL;DR: Total cost of all parts - $182.51![Screenshot 2025-10-24 at 10.35.16.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTA1NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9a6e38c1a4552c745182c8a5a885dff5e5ddc5b1/Screenshot%202025-10-24%20at%2010.35.16.png)
